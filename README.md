This is a portfolio page, written entirely by me, Michael Reed Welsh.
Most of the links will be inactive, as I do not actually have the projects in my portfolio that the images on the page represent.
I am creating this page as part of the Treehouse Techdegree program. The layout of the page will be based on mockups that are a part of that program.
