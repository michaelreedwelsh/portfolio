                <p>My name is Michael Welsh. Currently I am studying front end web development through the Treehouse Techdegree program. I am also very active on Freecodecamp and Codecademy for supplemental learning and practice. It is my intention to become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript before the end of this year. I am also teaching myself SQL and Ruby.  </p>

                    <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                    <p>This is a landing page for my hometown of Chestertown, Maryland. I put this together during a course on Treehouse.</p>

                    <h3>Random Number Generator</h3>
                    <p>This is a random number generator made using basic Javascript, a Bootstrap button, and some basic HTML and CSS. The button doesn't actually call a function, it refreshes the page.</p>

                    <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>
                    <p>This project doesn't actually exist yet. I will eventually build something like this and replace the dead link. It will probably be filled with pictures of my dog.</p>

                    <h3>Marketing Page</h3>
                    <p>This has something of a misleading title. This is a link to a profile page I have been putting together for myself as a way to play around with new techniques I learn. I am marketing myself, so it's not a complete misnomer.</p>

                    <h3>Search Page</h3>
                    <p>This is another project that does not yet exist. The Treehouse project, for which I am building this page, calls for six items in the portfolio. The link takes you to Google. I am in no way associated with Google.</p>

                    <h3>Travel App</h3>
                    <p>This link is also inactive. I have not built a travel app. I may one day. I will be in Spain for 3 weeks at the end of April so perhaps I will change this link to a travel blog.</p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Currently I work as a bartender and manager in a busy corporate restaurant. I believe many of the skills I have learned in this industry to be relevant in any work environment.</p>
                
                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <p>Keeping a restaurant running smoothly requires tending to it's many moving parts. I believe this skill is useful in any industry. I frequently manage a staff of up to 20 people and know how to keep people working together towards a common goal.</p>
                
                <h3>Multitasking</h3>
                <p>Tending bar can be chaotic. You have to plan 10 steps ahead and have both hands doing something at all times. Over the years I learned to keep a level head and remain calm during stressful moments. I plan ahead and always know what I am doing next.</p>
                
                <h3>Customer Service</h3>
                <p>I have spent many years engaging with customers face to face. I know how to communicate well with people who don't necessarily know exactly what they want. I am very good at explaining things to people in simple and understandable terms.</p>
